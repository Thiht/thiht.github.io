It allows to manage multiple terminal sessions within the same console. In a way, it does the same thing as modern terminal emulators such as Terminator or Terminology with their built-in tab system and layout management. The main benefit is that screen also works through an SSH connection: you will be able to use your screen knowledge and configuration on any machine supporting screen in the world!\nscreen has been around for almost 30 years so it's pretty stable now. It is released under the GPL license.\nThe main issue I had when starting with screen was its relative difficulty when compared to simple terminal emulators. So I will make a tour of the most useful keyboard shortcuts for a practical use, and share with you my screen config. You can also jump directly to the cheatsheet if you want.\nBasic usage\nscreen is not installed by default, so you need to install it first using your package manager.\nTo start screen, open a terminal and run the command screen. Not that hard, is it?\nWe're ready to start learning screen. Don't worry, that's only a few commands!\nWindow management\nNow you have opened screen, the first thing you need to know is how to create a new \"window\" (i.e. a new virtual terminal). To do so, press the keys Ctrl+a, and then press c. The screen shortcuts all consist of Ctrl+a (called \"escape key\" or \"prefix\") followed by another key. You now have two windows opened running in parallel, you can have vim in the first one, and a bash in the second one for example, and that's what screen is all about.\nYou can visualize all the opened windows with Ctrl+a \". This view allows you to navigate through your windows with the arrow keys, the 0-9 numbers and the enter key. This command is great because it gives you a global overview of your current session, I used it a lot at first.\nBut there are more ways to navigate through the windows! I personally use almost exclusively the commands Ctrl+a p (previous window) and  Ctrl + a n (next window). These shortcuts require to have your windows in mind though, but it comes with practice. And don't forget Ctrl+a \" is here to rescue you in case of doubt. ;)\nIt's also possible to jump to another window with the command Ctrl+a number, where number is a number between 0 and 9. This matches the \"Num\" column of the Ctrl+a \" view.\nFinally, you can kill a window when you have no use for it anymore. To do so, just press Ctrl+d in the shell. There's also a screen command with the \"same\" effect but it's usually better to proceed this way. Note if you kill all the windows of a session, the session terminates.\n\nSummary:\n\nCtrl+a c to create a new window\nCtrl+a \" to visualize the opened windows\nCtrl+a p and Ctrl+a n to switch with the previous/next window\nCtrl+a number to switch to the window number\nCtrl+d to kill a window\n\nSession management\nNow you can manage your windows, it is time you learn how to manage your screen sessions.\nYou just learned you can terminate a session by killing all its windows, that's a good start. We will now see how to exit a session without killing it. It means you'll be able to manage multiple persistent sessions in parallel. This is called \"detaching\" a session. To be clear, a detached session is a session which is still active in background, but on which no one is connected. An attached session is a session which is active and currently used.\nThe first thing I'll ask you to do is to kill your current screen session if you haven't done it already. You can then list all your screen sessions by running the command screen -ls. If all your sessions are closed, it should print something like:\n\nNow, we'll start a new session, but we'll give it a name so that we can come back to it more easily later. Run the command screen -S my_session. If you run the command screen -ls, you should obtain something like:\n\nSince you're connected to the session, it's presented as attached.\nNow you're connected to a session named \"my_session\", you can detach it from the current terminal with the command Ctrl+a d. This should result in a message like:\n\nAs usual, you can list the currently running sessions with screen -ls. This time, \"my_session\" should be listed as detached:\n\nI suggest you start and detach a few screen sessions to understand how it works. Be careful not to use the same session name twice, screen allows it but it can be more painful to resume a session if there are name conflicts.\nWith multiple screen sessions, the screen -ls gives something like:\n\nIf there aren't any conflicts, you can resume a session simply with the command screen -x session_name. So for example if you run screen -x my_session, your session \"my_session\" will be resumed with the windows you opened before! And if you run screen -ls, it should appear as attached:\n\nA last useful thing you should know is how to kill a detached session without connecting to it. To do so, the command to run is a bit tricky: screen -S session_name -X quit. This means you pass the command \"quit\" to the session named \"session_name\". It's a bit hard to remember so I generally simply resume my session and kill all its windows one by one.\n\nSummary:\n\nscreen -ls to list the sessions and their status\nscreen -S session_name to start a session with a given name. The name\nshould be unique\nCtrl+a d to detach a session\nscreen -x session_name to resume (reattach) a session knowing its name\nscreen -S session_name -X quit to terminate a detached session\n\nAdvanced usage\nThe hardest part is over! You have discovered screen and you know how to use it. All you need now is practice.\nIn this section, I'll present a few interesting features of screen, but they're definitely not necessary to use it, so feel free to come back and read this part later.\nLayout management\nIn the introduction, I talked about how Terminator and Terminology can work as layout managers. The good news is screen also permits to do that. So to split horizontally, you can use the command Ctrl+a S, and to split vertically you can use Ctrl+a |.\nTo switch to the next region (this is how the split panes are called), the command to use is Ctrl+a &lt;Tab&gt;. Each region behaves normally: you can run any command you have learned so far.\nTo close the current region, use Ctrl+a X. If you work with a lot of panes, you can close them all but the current one with Ctrl+a Q.\n\nSummary:\n\nCtrl+a S to split horizontally\nCtrl+a | to split vertically\nCtrl+a &lt;Tab&gt; to switch to the next region\nCtrl+a X to close the current region\nCtrl+a Q to close all the regions but the current one\n\nWork with the buffer\nTo follow, I'll talk about an important feature of screen: the copy mode, or scrollback mode.\nTo enter the copy mode, the command is either Ctrl+a &lt;Esc&gt; or Ctrl+a [, choose your side. The copy mode allows you to navigate through the console buffer without using your mouse. Since you can't use your wheel to scroll by default, this is the normal way to go back in the results. This mode lets you use some vim commands for the movements (arrow keys, 0, $, g, G, etc.).\nYou can copy some text (that's what the mode is for!) by marking the beginning and the end of a section with the space bar. You can then paste it with Ctrl+a ].  For more informations, check the man screen and look for \"copy\".\n\nSummary:\n\nCtrl+a &lt;Esc&gt; or Ctrl+a [ to enter in copy mode\n&lt;Space&gt; to select and copy some text in copy mode\nCtrl+a ] to paste the content of the buffer\n\nSession sharing\nI'll finish with a last screen feature I want you to know about: it allows to share a session between multiple users. When working on a remote server, this comes really handy.\nSo first, you have to start a session as usual. Then, we'll use the command mode of screen to enable the multiuser mode and give the access right to some users. To enter the command mode, type Ctrl+a :. You can then enable the multiuser mode with the command multiuser on.\nThen to add a specific user to the session, enter the command mode again with Ctrl+a : and type the command acladd username (ACL stands for \"Access Control List\") with the name of the user you want to add instead of username.\nThe user username is now able to join your session simply with the command screen -x your_username/session_name. The session is completely shared, which means you can see what the other users do in real time and so can they.\nWhen a session is shared with multiple users, it can be nice to know who is currently connected on it. You can have this info and more thanks to the command Ctrl+a *. The view shows a few useful informations, namely the window a user is currently using, or their permissions.\nFinally, you can revoke the access rights of user with the command acldel username in command mode. There's more you can do to manage a shared session, but I won't go into details, the man page covers everything. Now you have a basic understanding of screen, it should be easier to understand.\n\nSummary:\n\nCtrl+a : to switch to command mode\n\n\"multiuser on\" to enable the multiuser mode\n\"acladd username\" to give the access rights to the user username\n\"acldel username\" to remove the access rights to the user username\n\n\nscreen -x owner/session_name to join a session started by another user\nCtrl+a * to list the other connections to a session\n\nPractical tips\nAutomatically list the screen sessions\nWhen I start my terminal, I like it to list the current screen sessions. To do so, I simply added the screen -ls command to my .bashrc. So now whenever I open a terminal, I'm welcomed with my screen status:\n\nNot only is it really useful to have this status without asking for it, but it is also a good way to think about always using screen.\nGood aliases\nAs you're now aware, screen uses a lot of options. I tried to keep only the most useful in this article but they're still a pain to remember. A good way to remember them is to use aliases. I personally use the following:\n\nThese aliases don't conflict with anything standard and they're really easier to remember and to type, so I strongly advise you to use them!\nCustom configuration\nscreen can be customized in various ways through a .screenrc file, located in your home folder. One of the most useful tricks is the status bar.\n\nI won't go through the configuration of screen in details (you can read man screen or other articles to learn more), but simply share my commented .screenrc with you:\n\nNote you can enable any of these options directly from screen's command mode.\nCheatsheet of the main commands\nBasic usage\nCommandDescription\nscreenStart a session\nscreen -ls List the sessions and their status\nscreen -S session_nameStart a session named \"session_name\"\nscreen -x session_nameResume the session named \"session_name\"\nscreen -S session_name -X quitTerminate the session named \"session_name\"\n\nCommandDescription\nCtrl+a cCreate a new window\nCtrl+a kKill the current window (Ctrl+d does the same thing)\nCtrl+a \"List the opened windows\nCtrl+a p/nGo to the previous/next window\nCtrl+a 0-9Go to the window n\nCtrl+a dDetach the screen session\nCtrl+a :Enter the command mode\n\nSplit mode\nCommandAction\nCtrl+a SSplit horizontally\nCtrl+a ``\nCtrl+a &lt;Tab&gt;Go to the next region\nCtrl+a XClose the current region\nCtrl+a QClose all the regions but the current one\n\nCopy mode\nCommandAction\nCtrl+a &lt;Esc&gt;/[Enter the copy mode\n&lt;Space&gt;Mark a selection\nCtrl+a ]Paste the content of the buffer\n\nShared session\nCommandAction\nCtrl+a : multiuser onEnable the multiuser mode\nCtrl+a : acladd usernameGive the access rights to username\nCtrl+a : acldel usernameRevoke the access rights to username\nCtrl+a *List the other connections to the session\nscreen -x owner/session_nameJoin a session started by another user\n\nConclusion\nscreen is a powerful tool if you use the terminal a lot. Yet, it has some drawbacks, that can be pretty annoying. To list a few you will be confronted to if you really try to use it:\n\nbad UTF-8 support. There are a few configurations to make screen work fine with unicode, but it's still a bit messy. I am not even sure there is a proper way to handle UTF-8 characters in the status bar...\ninsane status bar configuration. You can see it in the .screenrc I provided, crafting a neat status bar is really hard. It's a shame given how useful they are!\n\nGood news though, all these issues are allegedly solved with tmux, another more recent terminal mutiplexer. I've only used it as a replacement of screen for a few days so I will wait a bit before reviewing it, but it's very similar to screen in its usage, and I'm very satisfied with it so far.\n","id":"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/screen-terminal-multiplexer/","title":"Learn to use screen, a terminal multiplexer"},"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/shell-scripts-matter/":{"body":"\nThe shell is an odd beast. Although it goes against every current trend in software engineering (strong typing, compile checks over runtime checks, ...), shell scripts are here to stay, and still constitute an important part of every developer's life.\nThe weird thing about shell scripts is that even strong advocates of good practices gladly forget all they know when it comes to shell scripting.\n\nVersioning? Why bother, it's disposable code.\nCode quality? That's just a shell script, it's garbage anyway.\nTesting? Nah. There aren't any decent tools for that.\n\nWrong, wrong, and wrong. Shell scripts have value. Everything you do for real code should be done for non trivial shell scripts, even for a one-time script. That includes versioning, code reviews, continuous integration, static code analysis, and testing.\nHere is a summary of everything that can, and should be done when writing shell scripts.\nNote: This article will use Bash as a reference shell. Most of the content can be transposed to other POSIX compliant shells.\nKeep your scripts in version control\nKeeping shell scripts under version control has multiple advantages:\n\nIt constitutes a library. Shell scripts can be hard to write. If there's a reference for something difficult somewhere, your coworkers will thank you when they need it. You should setup a \"shell-scripts\" repository somewhere as soon as possible.\nThey can be properly reviewed. Making mistakes is easy with shell scripts, and they can be very damaging. Code review should be mandatory for shell scripts, as for any other piece of code.\nThey can be improved. I won't explain to you what version control is. But with shell scripts versioned, it's easy to improve them regularly.\n\nPlease, from now on, version all your shell scripts before running them. Have someone reviewing your scripts in priority before executing them in production. It's not a waste of your coworkers' time, it's a time saver for the team.\nImprove the quality of your scripts with ShellCheck\nAlthough you can check the syntactic validity of your scripts with the command bash -n, much powerful tools exist.\nShellCheck is a static code analysis tool for shell scripts. It's really an awesome tool which will help you improve your skills as you use it. So do use it. You can install it globally on your machine, use it in your continuous integration, and it even integrates perfectly with most major editors. There really are no downsides to using ShellCheck and it can save you from yourself.\nIf Steam had used ShellCheck in 2015, this line would never have made it to production:\n\nThis code violates the SC2115 rule from ShellCheck.\nUse Bash unofficial strict mode\nThe unofficial strict mode comes from Aaron Maxwell's article \"Use the Unofficial Bash Strict Mode (Unless You Looove Debugging)\". He suggests to start every Bash script with the following lines:\n\n\n\nset -e will exit the script if any command returns a non-zero status code. To prevent the option from triggering on commands returning a non-zero status code even when no error occurred, there are two solutions:\n\n\nusing the || true pattern:\n\n\n\ntemporary disabling the option:\n\n\n\n\n\nset -u will prevent using an undefined variable. In the case of undefined positional parameters ($1, $2, ...), you can give them a default value with the parameter expansion construct:\n\n\n\nset -o pipefail will force pipelines to fail on the first non-zero status code.\n\n\nIFS=$'\\n\\t' makes iterations and splitting less surprising, in the case of loops mostly. The default for this variable is usually IFS=$' \\n\\t' but the space as a separator often gives confusing results.\n\n\nRead the original article for more details and solutions for common challenges when using the strict mode!\nThe unofficial strict mode is more intrusive than what we've seen before and can be hard to deal with, but it's worth it in the long run. Take the time to try it.\nDo some cleanup!\nWhen scripts are interrupted, either because of a user's action or because something bad occurred, most shell scripts don't clean up their mess. In the worst case, they might not restart services they had to temporarily disable. It's a shame given how easy it is to perform some cleanup and error catching with the trap command.\nOnce again, in \"How \"Exit Traps\" Can Make Your Bash Scripts Way More Robust And Reliable\", Aaron Maxwell gives some great advice.\nAlways add the following in your shell scripts:\n\nThe trap command will execute the cleanup function as soon as the script exits. In this function you could remove temporary files, restart services, or whatever is relevant to your script.\nTest your scripts with shUnit2\nshUnit2 is a unit testing framework for shell scripts. It's inspired by JUnit. It's available in the standard repositories so you can install it with apt-get install shunit2 on an Ubuntu-based distro.\nshUnit2 consists of a shell script you can source in your test file. To use it, there are multiple approaches. In order not to clutter the main script, I prefer writing the tests in a separate file. This means I'll have a script.sh file and a test_script.sh file.\nBelow is an example for a script offering a function to add two numbers.\nadd.sh must have the following structure:\n\nThe [[ \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" = \"$0\" ]] test is used to execute the main code only when the script is executed directly, not sourced.\ntest_add.sh will look like this:\n\nFirst, the test file sources the main file add.sh (in Bash, . is an alias to source). The functions it declares are then available in the test script.\nThe actual tests are simple functions with a name starting by test. At the end, the globally installed shunit2 is sourced and performs its magic.\nThe test file can then be executed:\n\nThe details of what shUnit2 can do are explained in its documentation.\nThere are alternatives to shUnit2, such as Bats or Roundup but I didn't have a chance to use them yet. Their usage should be relatively similar though. The point of this section is that testing shell scripts is doable and should be done, whatever solution you choose in the end.\nLog what your script is doing\nIn the past, I made the mistake of not logging anything. I liked running a script and seeing it work magically without anything ugly showing in the console. I was wrong, because when something doesn't work as expected, it becomes impossible to know what happened. Running a script is not supposed to feel like magic, it must be somewhat verbose and understandable. For that, please log as much as possible in your scripts.\nFor this purpose, I usually add the following lines in my scripts:\n\nThis tiny logging framework allows to easily keep track of whatever happens during the script execution. Logging becomes as simple as writing info \"Executing this and that...\". Then it's easy to grep on the log file to find something specific. Feel free to improve these functions as you need, with the date, the calling function name (with $FUNCNAME), etc.\nI don't use the builtin logger because it requires special privileges to write to /var/log and I'm not fond of its usage. Writing to a log file in /tmp is usually good enough. For cron scripts though you should probably investigate logger.\nUse the -v or --verbose of the commands you invoke as needed to improve the quality of your logging.\nLearn to debug your scripts\nThe easiest way to debug a shell script, besides logging, is to run it with bash -x. Another way is to use set -x inside the script. This option will make Bash print every command before its execution, replacing the variables with their real values. Used together with the unofficial strict mode, this method is useful to see what's going on in a script with less risk to break the environment.\nIt's also worth knowing that a few debuggers for Bash exist, for example bashdb. bashdb works in the same way as gdb, and can be used to add breakpoints, switching to step by step execution, showing the value of variables, etc. You can learn how to use bashdb with the video \"Using BashDB to Debug Your Shell Scripts \":\n\n  \n  \n\nDocument your scripts\nAny shell script should have a --help option. This doesn't seem easy? It is, thanks to the following wizardry:\n\nThe usage function will print every line starting with #/ comments, without this prefix.\nThe expr command will check if the string resulting of the concatenation of all the parameters contains --help. If so, it will call usage.\nThis is definitely not the cleanest way to parse parameters, but this quick method ensures you will add a --help flag.\nFor the sake of good practices, this StackOverflow post explains how to properly parse a script's parameters using the while/case/shift construct.\nTo generate HTML documentation from your comments, you can also check shocco.sh, which inspired the above trick.\nRandom advice\nThe following is a list of random good practices I've learned the hard way. I'll explain the rationale behind every advice as I go.\nUse Bash for scripting\nUse Bash by default, Sh if you have to. Try to forget about Ksh, Zsh or Fish unless there are really good reasons to use them. This choice not only ensures your script will work virtually everywhere, but also fosters comprehension of a script by the whole team. You don't write production scripts for yourself.\nUse Bashisms\nIf you use Bash, don't half-use it. Use parameter expansion. Use local and readonly variables. Use improved conditional expressions.\nQuote your variables\nEven if you know quoting is not required, it's a good habit to always quote variables. The only exception is when you specifically want expansion to occur. More on word splitting.\nName your parameters\nThis goes without saying, but explicitly naming parameters ($1, $2, ...) makes the code self-documenting and helps readability. The parameter expansion of Bash is a great candidate for naming and assigning default values to positional parameters:\n\nUse subshells as a way to control what's in your global scope\nAn example is worth a thousand words:\n\nwill print:\n\nMy main usage for this is when I need to temporarily modify $IFS (for iterating over simple CSV-like files for example) and reset it to its original value afterwards.\nUse a template\nThis script template summarizes every snippets shared along this article. I believe it's a good basis for any kind of script.\n\nStay informed\nShell scripting isn't moving that much these days. It's a great reason to read stuff about the topic, it makes it easy to keep up! Here are some interesting resources:\n\nman bash, I bet almost none of you have read it, yet it's a great source of information! And it's not that hard to read, I promise.\n@UnixTooltip on Twitter, continuously gives tips and tricks.\nMost upvoted Bash questions on StackOverflow\nBash participative documentation on StackOverflow has some interesting examples.\nShellCheck's wiki is a good resource to learn what not to do, and why.\nHacker News and /r/programming, once in a while articles on this subject pop out.\n\n\nI hope this article brought light on what was possible with shell scripting. The tools are there. You know the practices. Now it's up to you to make scripting a delight to work with, for you and your team!\n","id":"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/shell-scripts-matter/","title":"Shell Scripts Matter"},"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/sql-transactions-in-go-the-good-way/":{"body":"In my last work experience, I designed what I consider a pretty cool and efficient way to manage database transactions across a Go codebase. In a nutshell, I wanted to use database transactions in my business logic without exposing database internals.\nAfter dogfooding a solution for a while, I extracted it, improved it, and enriched it, to finally release it as the transactor library. This library is now tested across the most common relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MSSQL and Oracle), and is compatible with database/sql, jmoiron/sqlx and jackc/pgx.\nIn my current job, transactors are now our main (soon to be unique!) way to manage database transactions, which is why I feel comfortable talking about this method more widely.\nIn this article, I’ll walk you through the design and implementation so you can either use the lib, or adapt it and extend it depending on your needs.\nWhy exactly do we need a library?\nIn web services / APIs, it’s customary to use some kind of layered architecture, like Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture, or anything that boils down to a three-tier architecture. In Go, it’s something like:\n\nHandlers (a.k.a. controllers): the entrypoints of the API, usually the only layer allowed to be aware of the router and current HTTP request/response handlers,\nServices (a.k.a. usecases): the business layer, where the domain logic lives,\nStores (a.k.a. repositories, data access, storage, persistence…): the layer communicating with databases, caches, filesystems, and so on. It’s usually the only layer allowed to be aware of the concrete storage systems. In practice, it means it’s the only place where database/sql, your DB driver, or your ORM should be imported.\n\nWhether transactions should be allowed in the services layer is sometimes up for debate, as they’re somewhat tied to the DB implementation. In Go, a transaction is represented by *sql.Tx, but according to the definitions above, using it directly in the services layer would require importing database/sql. This is why it’s sometimes accepted that transactions should live in the storage layer only.\nI disagree with this.\nI strongly believe transactions can be used both in the storage layer and in the services layer, for different reasons. Specifically, transactions can be a part of the business logic, and are a part of an interface contract. But I also believe neither *sql.DB, *sql.Tx or database/sql should be imported by the services. This is the reason why I needed to create an object that could be injected to the services, allowing them to make transactions safely across many stores, without exposing any implementation details. The solution to this problem is the transactor library.\nThe Transactor interface\nA transactor lets you create a transactional context, represented by a closure. It’s defined as a simple interface:\n\nA transactor implements this interface. We can then inject it in a service, and use it to make some transactional calls completely transparently, without knowing anything about the database. Let's look at some sample code.\nExample code without a transaction\n\nThis way to manage a financial balance is not great for several reasons, but let’s focus on it as a case study. Without going into too much details (“what transactions are used for” is not the topic here).\nThis first version, doesn’t use a transaction. It makes it possible to get an inconsistent resulting balance.\nExample code using a transactor\n\nThis second version wraps GetBalance and SetBalance in a transaction, essentially making the operation atomic.\nThe changes made when using the Transactor are minimal, as they just impact 2-3 lines in this case, but here’s what happens in details:\n\nWithinTransaction accepts a context and a callback:\n\nThe context will be enriched with the transaction ; more on that later,\nThe enriched context is passed to the callback, which I call a transactional context,\nTo keep the changes minimal, the parent context is shadowed in the callback by naming it ctx ; this has no unintended effects, and makes it impossible to misuse the transactor (eg. by using the wrong context in one of the calls),\n\n\nWithinTransaction does essentially three things to manage the transaction workflow:\n\nBegin the transaction,\nExecute the callback,\nCommit, or Rollback the transaction.\n\n\n\nThis workflow is detailed in the flowchart below.\n\nAnd voilà! The transactor makes using transactions fool proof, and extremely easy.\nAnd the best thing is, there’s more.\nNesting transactions\nTransactors, when properly implemented, make it possible to deal with nested transactions. The implementation for nested transactions varies depending on the database, but the transactor library provides an implementation for all the major systems.\nYou can use a transactor anywhere, and you don’t have to worry if the methods you call use a transactor themselves. As an example, the following code making use of our previously defined IncreaseBalance is completely valid and working as you would expect:\n\nor, more generally:\n\nJust like that, we made transactional methods composable inside a larger transaction. Compared to other ways of dealing with transactions, such as Unit of Work, transactors make it really straightforward to compose anything inside a transaction: store methods, methods across different stores (working on the same storage system), or business services.\nImplementing a database/sql Transactor\nTo illustrate the above, let’s dive into the implementation of a transactor for database/sql from the Go standard library.\nThe full reference implementation can be found in transactor/stdlib/transactor.go.\nThe very basic structure we’ll need will evolve a bit as we go, but let’s get started:\n\nIn this first step, we create a private transactor implementing the Transactor interface.\n*sql.DB is a database handler representing an active connection to the database. It’s the result of sql.Open.\n\nWith the general structure in place, we can start implementing the WithinTransaction logic. As we expect it, its role will be to manage the transaction and execute the provided callback within this context.\n\nThis implementation already deals with most of the workflow: the transaction is started with BeginTx, the txFunc callback is then executed, and the transaction is either Committed or Rollbacked depending on the callback result.\nThe actual magic happens at line 7, with the txToContext function call:\n\ntxToContext stores the transaction (an *sql.Tx instance) as a context key,\nthe context, enriched with the transaction, is passed to the callback function.\n\nWe can implement txToContext like this:\n\nUsing a private struct type as a context key ensures nothing will conflict: this key can only be set by using txCtxKey.\n\nAt this point, the transactor logic is done. The actual transactor/stdlib implementation is a bit more complex because it can deal with nested transactions, but the logic is the same.\nThe only thing we miss is a way to actually use our transactor. When making our database queries, we must either check if our context contains a transaction, or use the DB connection directly.\nTo do so, we need a helper to give us the current transaction or connection from a context: the DBGetter. Let’s modify the NewTransactor constructor to give us a DBGetter:\n\ntxFromContext does the opposite of our previous txToContext function and is implemented as:\n\nDB is simply an interface defining the common methods between *sql.DB and *sql.Tx, so that we can use a DB handler or a transaction indistinctly:\n\nThe DBGetter we define will always return the initial *sql.DB handler by default, even if the context is completely empty (eg. context.Background() or nil), which makes it safe to use anywhere. The only way it can return a transaction is if it’s called inside a WithinTransaction block, as part of the txFunc callback we defined earlier.\n\nThese changes conclude the transactor implementation. As you’ll see in the examples below, the key for it to work as intended is to always use the DBGetter to make database queries, never the *sql.DB directly. This is the only way that these functions will know to use an active transaction.\nThe following code is an example implementation of the balanceStore described at the beginning of this article, making use of the DBGetter:\n\n\nUsing the context to pass information is sometimes controversial in the Go community, but in this case I feel the benefits vastly outweigh the cons. In fact, after using transactors for almost a full year in various situations, I'd say there isn't anything that would make me go back to an alternative method for managing transactions.\nAnyway, that’s it for today! I hoped you enjoyed this article, and if you did, I encourage you to give my transactor library a try in one of your projects, and maybe ⭐&nbsp;it on GitHub!\n","id":"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/sql-transactions-in-go-the-good-way/","title":"SQL Transactions in Go: The Good Way"},"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/tdd-is-a-personal-practice/":{"body":"I know TDD. I know what real TDD is. I know how to do it right, whatever that means depending on the TDD practitioner.\nI still don’t like this practice, and rarely use it, except in 2 situations:\n\nI’m fixing a bug in an existing code base: in this case I’ll write a test first to reproduce and isolate the bug, and then fix it and refactor if needed\nI’m adding a new use case to an existing feature, and will treat the lack of existence of this new case as a bug, see 1.\n\nI don’t ever, ever, EVER use TDD to write new features from scratch. It doesn’t work for me. It doesn’t match my mental model. It doesn’t help me go faster, doesn’t make me produce better code, and doesn’t make me write more, or more useful tests. I don't enjoy it and it doesn't provide me with any kind of satisfaction.\nI still have a personal methodology, but it’s not TDD. I still strive to write good test and maintain good coverage, but not doing TDD.\nTDD should not be forced upon developers who don’t want to follow it, in the same way a specific IDE should not be forced upon a developer. TDD is a tool, not a goal in itself. The shared goal is to have a well tested code base that is as safe as possible from regressions. How developers achieve that doesn’t matter.\nTDD should not be conflated as \"writing tests\". I often see the rhetoric that, if you don’t do TDD, then you don’t write tests. If I showed you a code base with tests, there would be no way for you to know if they’ve been written in TDD or not.\nTDD is not a team practice. Writing tests is a team practice. Code review is a team practice. Automated CI is a team practice. Whether a developer does or does not do TDD has no impact on the rest of the team. I could tell you I'm doing TDD if it pleases you, and you'd have no way to know that I don't, micro-managing set aside.\nIf in TDD you trust, don’t proselytize it. TDD is a personal practice.\n","id":"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/tdd-is-a-personal-practice/","title":"TDD is a personal practice"},"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/writing-testing-a-paginated-api-iterator/":{"body":"Go 1.23, amongst other features, brought Iterators to the standard library.\nIterators are basically a way to make the range operator work on functions implementing a specific interface. This lets you write code like this:\n\nThe main difference with using range over a slice or a map is that an iterator can fetch data lazily. I doesn’t need to fetch all the data at once before writing the loop. This comes really handy for consuming paginated APIs: we can write an iterator abstracting the pagination logic, making the code more readable and reusable.\nIn this article I’ll show you how to write a custom iterator for consuming a paginated HTTP API (we’ll use GitHub’s API as an example), and how to test it properly by leveraging Pull Iterators.\n\nNote that this article will not discuss the design of iterators in Go, we’ll just see how to use and work with them. For more information on iterators, I recommend these articles:\n\nRanging over functions in Go 1.23\nRange Over Function Types\n\nWriting an Iterator\nIterators can return up to two values. They must implement one of these signatures:\n\niter.Seq (func(yield func(V) bool): iterators over sequences of 1 value\niter.Seq2 (func(yield func(K, V) bool): iterators over sequences of 2 values\nfunc(yield func() bool): iterators over sequence of… no value :)\n\nFor iterators working over remote resources like APIs, the emerging idiom is to use the second value for error handling. In practice, using our iterator will look like this:\n\nI noticed a few naming conventions for functions returning an iterator:\n\nIterateResources\nIterResources\nResourcesSeq\n\nI’m not sure yet which is the more common, but I went with Iterate in this article as it feels clearer.\n\nWe’ll implement an iterator looking like the above using the GitHub API to list the repositories of a user.\nI chose this API for 3 reasons:\n\nit's public and doesn't require authentication. You can give it a try in a terminal:\n\nit's paginated, so it's a good use-case for an iterator,\nthe Go module google/go-github is readily available to interact with the GitHub API.\n\nWith google/go-github, we’ll use the RepositoriesService.ListByUser method. As a starting point, let’s write a version of the code listing all my repositories, without an iterator.\n\nThe pagination parameters are passed via ListOptions, and the next page to fetch is retrieved at each loop from the resp result. I set the pagination settings to list the repositories 5 by 5 so that we get a chance to see the pagination in action.\nThis code works fine, but it forces us to mix the pagination logic (checking the NextPage value and updating opts.Page) with our business logic (printing the repository name). It also suffers from a lack of standardization: any API you use will be different. Not only REST APIs, but also filesystem APIs, custom collections, or whatever. Iterators will help us abstract anything related to the pagination and focus on our own logic.\nLet’s now rewrite the same code with an iterator:\n\nAs you can see, the iterator version is slightly more verbose, but it's more reusable and has the benefit of isolating the pagination logic from the rest of the code. Keep in mind in real life projects you’ll modify the business logic of the loop more often than you’ll modify the iterator itself, so it makes sense to take a bit of time writing an iterator to get simpler business code.\nIterateRepositoriesByUser is not an iterator itself, but a function returning an iterator. This lets us pass the parameters that will be available in the scope of the iterator: the context, the GitHub client, the target user, and the additional options.\nI declared a RepositoryLister interface to make it easier to test the iterator, we’ll come back to it in the next part.\nThe iterator consists of these steps:\n\n2.1: Initialization of the pagination params before calling the API: the pagination starts at page 1 on the GitHub API,\n2.2: Main loop listing the user’s repositories. Note that this is roughly the same code we had in the implementation without iterator: the pagination logic stays the same. The main difference is the use of yield to return our values and errors to range:\n\nIf ListByUser fails, yield the error and return: I decided to return unconditionally in case of failure, because I want the range to end if ListByUser fails.\nIf ListByUser succeeds, the repositories are yielded one by one.\n\n\n\nAs a reminder:\n\nyield returns true if the range loop continues (if the continue keyword is used, or if the loop continues to the next iteration),\nyield returns false if the range loop stops (if break or return are used, or if the loop is interrupted).\n\nTesting the Iterator\nIt can be a bit challenging to write tests for an iterator. In our tests we need to make sure that:\n\nthe iterator contains the elements we expect, in the correct order,\nthe iterator doesn’t contain more elements than we expect.\n\nMocking RepositoryLister\nUsing a mock is not the only way to write this test, just my personal preference. As github.NewClient accepts an *http.Client as a parameter, we could instead use net/http/httptest to control the HTTP calls and their responses.\nIn the above example, we used an interface RepositoryLister to abstract the GitHub API client. Thanks to this abstraction, we can mock the GitHub API client in our tests. We could use a mocking library like mockery to generate a mock for this interface automatically, but I'll write it manually for this example:\n\nThis mock lets you register the expected calls to ListByUser and the results you want to return.\nIt can be used as follows, in place of a RepositoryLister:\n\nWriting tests for the sequence\nTo test an iterator, I find it easier to first write down the expected sequence of values it returns. To do so, we can start by defining a type to represent the 2 values returned by an iteration:\n\nThis way we’ll be able to declare an expected sequence for a test:\n\nBefore writing our test, let’s setup our GitHub client mock with the expected responses to match this expected sequence:\n\nOur repositoryListerMock implements ListByUser, will return 2 repositories on the first page, and signal there’s no next page to fetch.\nWith all of this setup, we can finally test the iterator itself. The first trick here is to convert our iterator to a pull iterator to get finer control over the iteration sequence:\n\nThe actual testing consists of 3 parts:\n\nFirst, the iterator is initialized by calling IterateRepositoriesByUser with its expected parameters, including the mock client we created previously. We call iter.Pull2 to convert the iterator to a push iterator, which gives us 2 new variables: next and stop. next will give us the next values in the iterator, and a boolean indicating whether it still contained values.\nThen, we loop on the expectedIterations. That’s the second trick, we don’t loop directly on the iterator but instead on the sequence we expect. This lets us check all the values we expect one by one.\n\nThe first action in the loop is to call next to iterate. If the ok value returned by the iterator is false it means we expected more values than the iterator gave us, so the test fails.\nThen, we can simply check that the returned *github.Repository and error are the ones we expected.\n\n\nFinally we need to call next one last time to ensure the iterator is empty. If the ok value is true, it means the iterator contains more values than we expected. The test fails, and we need to rework our expectedSequence.\n\nThis approach makes it easy to test all the possible cases for this iterator. The below examples show how to write a few additional tests, such as an iterator calling multiple pages of results, or an iterator returning an unexpected error.\n\n","id":"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/writing-testing-a-paginated-api-iterator/","title":"Writing & Testing a Paginated API Iterator in Go"}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/screen-terminal-multiplexer/":{"body":1238,"title":5},"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/shell-scripts-matter/":{"body":1083,"title":3},"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/sql-transactions-in-go-the-good-way/":{"body":769,"title":5},"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/tdd-is-a-personal-practice/":{"body":194,"title":3},"https://blog.thibaut-rousseau.com/blog/writing-testing-a-paginated-api-iterator/":{"body":741,"title":6}},"length":7},"lang":"English"}
